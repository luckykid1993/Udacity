1. "Which were the most popular programming languages in 2017?"

2. "Which programming languages were the most people interested to work with over the next year?"

3. "Which programming language was most people loved?"

1. Most popular programming languages in 2017:

JavaScript (62%),

SQL (51%)

Java (39%)

2. Programming languages were the most people interested to work with over the next year:

JavaScript (48%)
